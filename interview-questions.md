# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Once the data is stored in state it is available to the entire React component. Props(properties) are specialized React objects used to pass information from one component to the other. Unlike state values, props are a one-way value and cannot be changed. State gets updated as the user interacts with the interface.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. DOM: Document Object Model - everything you see on the screen, a visual representation of the code structure.

2. Object-oriented programming: Refers to a type of computer programming, which programmers create relationships between one object to another using ineritance. The data structure becomes an object that contains the data and methods used. OOP was created to solve the issue of "spaghetti" code with the old procedural programming. Before the data could be easily modified by any function since they generally operate on the global data in large programs. This became an issue when it started to affect other functions that shared the same data. OOP was the solution to keep it in line. It is the concept of class and object. To make it more relateable to the real world. 

3. Ruby: A backend open source object-oriented programming language focused on simplicity and productivity. It relies on plain English words for easy readibility. Everything in Ruby is an object that can be modified and customized. It has been known as a programmer's best friend.
