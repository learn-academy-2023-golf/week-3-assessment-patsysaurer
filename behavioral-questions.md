# ASSESSMENT 3: Behavioral Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. Use the Nugget + STAR method for each answer.

1. Tell me about a project or accomplishment you‚Äôre proud of.

- Nugget: 
    While I was a full-time Pastry Chef, I was asked to do a job that had nothing to do with pastry from my boss. She remembered from my resume that I had an education and some experience in web design.

- Situation: 
    She was ready to completely modernize her website and offered to pay me a set price. Now although I had a degree in Web Design, I had very little experience and was out of practice. However I still sat down with her and pulled up the WordPress website. It seemed very doable so I agreed to the job and she sent me a mockup of what she was looking for. 

- Task: 
     I had to organize a list of everything that she wanted done. I knew I had to refresh my brain on web design since it was currently focused on making flaky danishes and pastry cream. I also had to find a modern WordPress template that would best fit her needs.

- Action: 
    I found a crash course on WordPress, HTML and CSS. Diving back into creative technology was really fun. I found a customizable template that fit her needs. Although it was an extra cost it seemed worth it, especially for how quickly we wanted it live. It took a good nine hours to add every single item, customize it, setup the forms and links, edit new images and testing. 

- Result: 
    I texted her a link to the new site and was kind of nervous to receive her reaction. It was completely different from her original site. Moments later a few emojis came in üôèüôèüôè She loved it! I was very relieved and also ready to just focus on one career at the time. Back to pastry I went and it felt good. However that project did make me feel very proud and boosted my confidence to want to learn more about development. 


2. Tell me about a time when you had to deal with a high-pressure situation in your job.

- Nugget: 
    Easter was the first holiday after the 2020 Covid shutdown. Pre-orders for the bakery were piling up like never before and with only two employees in that department me being one of them, the pressure was on. 

- Situation: 
    Every day the numbers were growing on how many eclairs, tarts, carrot cakes, chocolate chicks and salted caramel eggs had to be produced. I had help from the other baker, however he had his own list of tasks for artisan bread making. Both of our heads were spinning as we had to multitask with making so many different components in about a two week time frame. 

- Task: 
    I was tasked with creating a plan for execution and presenting sketches and flavor profiles to our main Chef. Once approved I needed to provide recipes and order ingredients. The other baker and I needed to agree on a schedule to both have our own kitchen times so that we can produce our individual tasks.  

- Action:
    First we constructed an action plan to stay on task. We had a list on the white board and a digital copy on Google Drive with the recipes. I first started with making chocolate products since those had the longest shelf life and they took more attention to detail. Then we took turns making components that could be frozen or refrigerated and labeled everything accordingly. Easter was only days away and we didn't realize how behind we were. We both ending up working 18 hour shifts to get the job done. Alternatively, we could have outsourced some of the items, however we stood by our values in making everything from scratch. 

- Result:
    Easter finally came and I was actually still behind. I took my chocolate work home and continued to make orders then took a nap. The first customer was expected at 11am so I arrived at the bakery at 3am. We were able to get every order out thanks to the time slots that were arranged. However, I was still tempering chocolate while the customers were walking in to pickup their orders. I think what might have helped was making a cut off time for accepting orders. It was a tough situation since the restaurant had just shut down dining service so it seemed like every order was helpful and not turned away.
